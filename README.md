TransferMaster is an AI powered transfer credit tool for schools and colleges. 
You can upload 2 syllabi (text files) and see how well the 2 courses match and how likely are they to transfer in as each other. 
You can also chat with the syllabi and ask questions about different sections. 
It was refactored with AutoGen.
