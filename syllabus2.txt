Description
IST 110: Information, People and Technology (3 credits) - The use, analysis and design of information systems and technologies to
organize, coordinate, and inform human enterprises.
Prerequisites
None
Objectives
Information, People and Technology presents the high points of an education in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. It
opens an intellectual journey through the ideas and challenges that IT professionals face in the world. It will address major questions such
as: How can we use technology to organize and integrate human enterprises? How can technology help people and organizations adapt
rapidly and creatively? What can we do about information overload?
Three perspectives (or facets) address the core issues: information or the basic science of data encoding, transmission and storage;
people or the interactions among technologies, institutions, regulations and users; and technology or the design and operation of basic
information technology devices. Students completing the course will be confident users and consumers of information technology.
Students will develop research and analytical skills to evaluate specific devices and understand how those devices function in larger sociotechnical systems. Students will be able to predict and anticipate the impact of new technologies on human institutions as well as
understand the potential impact of institutions on the use and design of information technologies.
The course employs an action-oriented approach. Students learn by doing—formulating and solving problems drawn from professional
contexts, detecting and recovering from errors related to technology use, and locating, reading and studying materials that support their

analysis and problem-solving. Students will accomplish this by participating in group-based learning. The course provides students with
the opportunity to use, modify, and evaluate software to search for, frame, and express ideas with fluency. A variety of mechanisms are
used to assess student performance. These evaluation methods typically include exams, quizzes, homework assignments, group projects,
and peer and self-assessments.
Note: Individual lessons objectives come from the corresponding chapters in the course textbook.
